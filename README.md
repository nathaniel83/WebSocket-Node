WebSocket Implementation for Node
=================================

*WARNING: THIS IS NOT READY FOR USE YET.*
This code is currently VERY experimental at best and is not stable for any kind of production use.

This is an implementation of the WebSocket Draft -07 in Node.  There are some example servers that implement various interoperability testing protocols in the "test" folder.

For a WebSocket -07 client written in Flash see my [AS3WebScocket](https://github.com/Worlize/AS3WebSocket) project.

If you're looking for the version supporting draft-06, see the draft-06 branch.  It will not be maintained, as I plan to track each subsequent draft of the protocol until it's finalized, and will ultimately be supporting *only* the final draft.

More to come soon...
