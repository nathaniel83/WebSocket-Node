WebSocket Implementation for Node
=================================

*WARNING: THIS IS NOT READY FOR USE YET.*
This code is currently VERY experimental at best and is not stable for any kind of production use.

This is an implementation of the WebSocket Draft -06 in Node.  See the examples folder for usage examples.  It contains a couple mini servers that implement a couple of the test protocols from Andy Green's libwebsockets-test-server.

For a WebSocket -06 client written in Flash see my [AS3WebScocket](https://github.com/Worlize/AS3WebSocket) project.

More to come soon...
